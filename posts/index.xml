        <description>Defensive programming is a great practice to adopt and I would generally advocate that we do so but we have to be careful we are still getting the value we expect from the practice.
Checking input for validity before we try to execute logic is a common practice and aims to error out qucikly before expending resources on something that will fail. In most cases this is the right thing to do.</description>

      <title>Tech Debt Tetris</title>

        <description>Some time ago I was getting an old gameboy up and running again and found myself enjoying a game of Tetris. It occurred to me that this game is not dissimilar to the concept of technical debt.
When you make a mistake in Tetris you end up with a hole in a row that is buried beneath subsequent rows. You can&amp;rsquo;t clear that row until you clear all the rows above it which accumulate as you make mistakes and introduce more holes.</description>

        <description>I&amp;rsquo;m quite a fan of a Canadian documentary series called Air Crash Investigations. The show re-enacts aviation incidents and the investigations that follow. Admittedly, its a little dark, but its absolutely fascinating. The debris field can be vast and there&amp;rsquo;s often very little left of the aircraft. None the less, the investigators painstakingly piece together the chain of events and sequences of errors that led to a plane falling out of the sky.</description>

        <description>stages of development of an engineer toddler everything is hard challenge to make things work child things are easier now we kind of understand the world around us we make lots of mess our code works now but is a tighly coupled nightmare teenager its a tough time for most of us look like an adult think like a child we dream up an ever more complex problem domain with non-existet requirements then we solve that problem!</description>

        <description>cables/switches punch cards assembler early programming languages (COBOL, FORTRAN, etc) modern programming languages (C#, JavaScript, etc) command-line interfaces (CLI) graphical user interfaces (GUI) touch interfaces voice interfaces gesture-based interfaces biosignal interfaces (e.g., brain-computer interfaces) &amp;hellip;.
What comes next
MS Build
copilot for all the things no longer interact with the software but interact with the AI and it operates the software for you what does UX look like for traditional user interfaces in this world do we start optimising UI so its easier for an AI to interact with even if its less optimal for a human Vision OS</description>

        <description>A while ago in a company I worked for I noticed something strange. We were doing all the ceremonies of Scrum with the sprint plannings and retros and so on, yet we seemed to be moving intolerably slowly. Everything took forever to get to prod and was often not in good shape by the time it got there.
Looking up into the management layer, executives and board members were wanting to know what we were dropping over the next few quarters, what big splash features we planned to implement, and how they would attract further investment.</description>

      <title>How to Make Your CV Stand Out</title>

        <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve sometimes taken the opportunity to speak on engineering career panels and a question often asked by new engineers or graduates is &amp;lsquo;How do I make my CV stand out?&amp;rsquo; The answers given are often of a similar ilk - write a cover letter, research the company, make sure the employer understands why you&amp;rsquo;re excited about their particular business. Whilst this is great advice, it may or may not make you stand out.</description>

        <description>It seems fitting that the first post should be about the inspiration for its title.
The physics nerds in the room can skip to the next paragraph. Zero Kelvin (-273.15C), otherwise known as absolute zero, is the coldest possible temperature in the universe. It is also impossible to reach. When you draw heat out of an object it immediately warms the surrounding environment preventing the object from ever reaching 0k. We&amp;rsquo;ve gotten very, very close &amp;hellip; but never quite there.</description>
