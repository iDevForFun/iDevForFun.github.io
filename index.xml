        <description>It seems fitting that the first post should be about the inspiration for its title.
The physics nerds in the room can skip to the next paragraph. Zero Kelvin (-273.15C), otherwise known as absolute zero, is the coldest possible temperature in the universe. It is also impossible to reach. When you draw heat out of an object it immediately warms the surrounding environment preventing the object from ever reaching 0k. We&amp;rsquo;ve gotten very, very close &amp;hellip; but never quite there.</description>

        <description>I am a software professional and leader who often finds myself drawing analogies with the non-software world. I like to use these as a tool to both remember and explain my ideas in non-technical terms which I find helps level the playing field when dealing with audiences with mixed levels of technical knowledge.
The name of this blog is one such analogy. We can never reach zero degrees Kelvin but it still exists.</description>
